# Lecture 02 README

It is *good practice* to **always provide** a README.md file in your
projects. In fact, we will require you to provide one in your
assignment submissions!

It has become customary to write your README.md files using a simple
text formatting language called [Markdown][gruber]. You must read up
on how to write proper Markdown for this course!
